**Ωmega Pruner v11.1 — Forged Anew + Pruning Conditions Badge**

The last UTXO consolidator you’ll ever need.

**New in v11.1**  
- **Pruning Conditions badge** — real-time score (1–10) with glowing nuclear design  
- Current economy fee vs 1-day / 1-week / 1-month medians (mempool.space mining data)  
- Clear vertical layout: current fee → VS → medians (1-day → 1-week → 1-month)  
- Live BTC price + current block height for instant context  
- Instant insight: know if *now* is prime pruning time before pasting addresses

**Optimized for modern Bitcoin** — fully supports:  
- Native SegWit (bc1q...)  
- Taproot (bc1p...)

Legacy (1...) and Nested SegWit (3...) inputs are shown for transparency but cannot be pruned (faded + disabled in table).
