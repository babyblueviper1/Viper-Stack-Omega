Deterministic selection export — JSON + fingerprint as proof  
Live mempool fee oracle — Economy / 1h / 30m / Fastest presets  
Privacy Score (0–100) — CIOH risk, linkage, merge exposure  
Tiered CIOH warnings — color-coded, impossible to miss  
“Prune now vs later” fee delta — see future regret in sats
