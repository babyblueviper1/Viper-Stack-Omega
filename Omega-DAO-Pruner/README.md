### Quick start

2. Tap **Run Pruner**  
3. (Optional) Check **Sweep to Lightning** → scan invoice → **Generate Transaction**  
4. Sign & broadcast with your favorite wallet  

That’s it. Dust gone. Fees saved. Swarm surged.

### Why it matters
Every tiny UTXO you have today will cost you **10–50× more** to spend next bull run.  
Prune when fees are low → pay pennies now instead of dollars later.  
This is **Bitcoin fee insurance**.
