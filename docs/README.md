  • 1-month

## Supported Address Types

Ωmega Pruner is **optimized for modern Bitcoin** and fully supports:

- **Native SegWit** (`bc1q...`) – P2WPKH
- **Taproot** (`bc1p...`) – P2TR

These offer the best privacy, lowest fees, and future compatibility.

**Legacy** (`1...`) and **Nested SegWit** (`3...`) inputs are displayed for transparency but **cannot be selected** or included in the generated PSBT (faded + disabled in table).

We recommend migrating to a modern wallet (e.g., Sparrow with Taproot) to fully benefit from pruning.

Most tools optimize for convenience.  
Ωmega Pruner optimizes for **truth, sovereignty, and architectural honesty**.

No keys.  
No signing.

No fake privacy.
