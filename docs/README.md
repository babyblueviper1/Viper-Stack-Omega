## Silent Payments (BIP-352) — The Truth

Silent Payments **require sender private keys** to compute the ECDH shared secret.

Ωmega Pruner is **deliberately unsigned and key-free**, preserving:
- zero custody  
- browser safety  
- air-gapped workflows  
- absolute user trust  

Anything else would be fake privacy.

**Full Silent Payments support is coming to Ωmega Wallet**  
*(local, self-custodial application)*

## Under the Hood — Canonical State Model

| Principle | Implementation | Why It Matters |
|--------|----------------|---------------|
| Single source of truth | Immutable `enriched_state` tuple | No stale UI, no drift |
| Derived economics & UI | All summaries computed live | Perfect consistency |
| Selection fingerprint | Deterministic hash of chosen UTXOs | Provable intent |

Audit-proof. Deterministic. Unbreakable.

## Philosophy

Most consolidators lie to you with half-implemented features.

**Prune with confidence.  
Win with certainty.**
