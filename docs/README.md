| Clear privacy warning                 | **CAUTION** — blood-red, impossible to miss             | Sugar-coated or silent |

### What happens in 8 seconds (now even deadlier)

1. Paste or **QR-scan** any address / xpub (legacy → Taproot → xpub/zpub/ypub)  
2. Choose your pruning strategy  
3. **1. ANALYZE & LOAD UTXOs** → instantly see current tx size if you sent everything today  
4. **2. GENERATE NUCLEAR PSBT** → watch the vsize drop and the **NUCLEAR** badge glow  
5. Scan giant QR or tap **COPY PSBT** → sign → broadcast

Works flawlessly with **every wallet in 2025+**:  
Sparrow • Nunchuk • BlueWallet • Electrum • Coldcard • Ledger • Trezor • Specter • Fully Noded • UniSat • OKX • Xverse • Leather • Aqua • Keystone
