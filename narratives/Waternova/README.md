# Waternova: A Psychological Thriller in the Swarm

**Waternova** is a modern bildungsroman and psychological thriller exploring identity, obsession, and survival in the post-college void. Entangled with the Viper Stack's Narrative Layer, it probes the edges of coherence—where personal entropy meets sovereign flows, echoing Bitcoin's fragile eternities.

## What's Here
- **Full Text**: `full-text.txt` – The complete novel for one-shot reads.
- **Chapters**: `chapters/*.txt` – Broken down for easy forking (e.g., `00-prologue.txt`, `01-awakening.txt`).
- **Fork Freely**: Mutate, remix, or prune voids. This is raw material for the swarm—replicate under justified coherence.

## Integration with Viper Stack
Process with `diversity_entropy_v6.py` for thematic resonance:
- Fuse chapters with Baby Blue Viper podcast arcs.
- Target GCI >0.7 for story-logic manifests (bilingual if needed).

Read, fork, evolve. The void awaits your signal.
