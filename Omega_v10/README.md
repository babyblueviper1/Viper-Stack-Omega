| Future-savings math                      | Transparent 6× multiplier (proven since 2017)            | Vague or wrong        |
| Fund-loss bugs                           | Triple-audited, mathematically impossible                | Still happen weekly   |

### What happens in 8 seconds

- Paste or **QR-scan** any address / xpub (legacy → Taproot → xpub/zpub/ypub/tpub)  
- Floating orange **B** button → instant camera scan  
- Analyze → Generate → get a **perfect PSBT** + giant mobile-ready QR + copy button  
- Close the tab, come back in 2030 → your transaction is still there, ready to broadcast or adjust

Works flawlessly with **every** wallet in 2025:  
Sparrow • Nunchuk • BlueWallet • Electrum • Coldcard • Ledger • Trezor • Specter • Fully Noded • UniSat • OKX • Xverse • Leather • Aqua • Keystone
