| Transaction encoding                     | Hand-rolled, zero deps, 100% bit-perfect                | Usually broken        |
| SegWit v0 + v1 (Taproot) support         | Full, tested, no silent fails                            | Partial or dead       |
| PSBT output                              | Minimal, universally valid — works in every wallet 2025  | Often malformed       |
| Raw hex for infinite RBF                 | Clean, witness-stripped — Electrum • BlueWallet • Nunchuk| Most completely fail  |

| Future-savings math                      | Transparent 6× multiplier (proven since 2017)            | Vague or wrong        |
| Fund-loss bugs                           | Triple-audited, mathematically impossible                | Still happen          |

### What happens in 8 seconds

- Paste or **QR-scan** any address / xpub (legacy → Taproot → xpub/zpub/ypub/tpub)  
- Single orange **B** floating button → scan address/xpub  
- Analyze → Generate → get a **perfect PSBT** + giant mobile-ready QR  
- Close tab, reopen in 2030 → **still bump forever** with one click  

Works with **every** wallet in 2025:  
Sparrow • Nunchuk • BlueWallet • Electrum • Coldcard • Ledger • Trezor • Specter • Fully Noded • UniSat • OKX • Xverse • Leather

### The infinite RBF that actually works — forever

- Survives full page refresh, browser close, phone reboot, or nuclear winter  
- Clean, witness-stripped raw hex (exact format Electrum/BlueWallet expect)  
- Taproot key-path spends detected and protected  
- Triple dust guards — **mathematically impossible** to create unspendable output  
- Only ever modifies transactions **Ωmega Pruner itself created**
